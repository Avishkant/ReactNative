**NumToWords**

This is a small React Native app that converts numeric values into readable words. It includes a utility with support for:

- **Numbering systems**: `western` (thousand/million) and `indian` (thousand/lakh/crore).
- **Languages**: English (`en`) and Hindi (`hi`).
- **Features**: handles negative numbers, fractional (decimal) parts, and trims leading zeros.

The core conversion utility is implemented at `src/utils/numberToWords.ts` and exported as `numberToWords` (supports an options object `{ system?: 'western' | 'indian', lang?: 'en' | 'hi' }`).

**Quick Start**

- **Install dependencies**: `npm install` (or `yarn`).
- **Run Metro**: `npm start`.
- **Run on Android (dev)**: `npm run android`.

**Build Release APK (shareable)**

- From the project root run (Windows PowerShell):

```powershell
Set-Location -LiteralPath 'android'
.\gradlew.bat assembleRelease
```

- The generated APK will be at: `android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`.
- Note: this project currently uses the debug keystore for release builds by default (`android/app/build.gradle` uses `signingConfigs.debug`). The produced `app-release.apk` is installable on devices but is not signed with a production key suitable for Play Store publishing.

**Create a proper release key**

If you want a production-signed APK (recommended for distribution to users or Play Store):

1. Generate a keystore (example):

```powershell
keytool -genkey -v -keystore my-release-key.keystore -alias my-key-alias -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
```

2. Place the keystore in `android/app/` and add the following to `android/gradle.properties` (or your environment):

```
MYAPP_RELEASE_STORE_FILE=my-release-key.keystore
MYAPP_RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS=my-key-alias
MYAPP_RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD=<store-password>
MYAPP_RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD=<key-password>
```

3. Update `android/app/build.gradle`'s `signingConfigs.release` to reference those properties and run the `assembleRelease` task again.

**Repository Notes**

- This folder (`NumToWords`) is a project subfolder inside the parent workspace `G:\Code_Playground\Android Developement`.
- The repository root is the parent folder. `NumToWords` has been converted to a normal folder (no nested `.git`). If you want `NumToWords` tracked as part of the parent repo, stage/commit as needed from the parent directory.

**Project Structure (key files)**

- `App.tsx` : App entry point and UI.
- `android/` : Native Android project and Gradle config.
- `ios/` : iOS project (for macOS builds).
- `src/utils/numberToWords.ts` : number-to-words implementation (supports `western`/`indian`, `en`/`hi`).
- `__tests__/` : Unit tests.

**Useful Commands**

- Install deps: `npm install`
- Run dev on Android: `npm run android`
- Build release APK: (see steps above)
- Install built APK on device via ADB:

```powershell
adb install -r "android\\app\\build\\outputs\\apk\\release\\app-release.apk"
```

**Troubleshooting**

- If you see path-length or CMake errors on Windows, create a short junction to the project root and build from there (example used during development):

```powershell
cmd /c mklink /J "C:\numtowords" "G:\Code_Playground\Android Developement\NumToWords"
Set-Location -LiteralPath 'C:\numtowords\android'
.\gradlew.bat assembleRelease
```

- If Kotlin/CMake incremental cache errors occur, try stopping Gradle daemon and cleaning build caches:

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat --stop
.\gradlew.bat clean
```
